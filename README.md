### Mission ###

Help neo-catechumenal cantors with musical technicalitie so that dey develop their charisma more efficiently. 

### Vision ###

Many cantors, especially women, cannot sing many songs which do not fit their voice range unless they transpose those songs. They may know how to transpose a song, but they struggle to find the right key which allows them to sing it well or just sing it, in many cases. The algorithm of Neo-Transposer measures their voice and calculates the right chords, so that they can sing every song, and develop their charisma for the _re-creation of the liturgical assembly_.

### Values ###

 * Be a help, not an obstacle, to the charisma and the customs of the Way.
 * Universal access: the app can be easily used with every device and connection, even in Africa. That's why this is open web technology and not a [native Android/iOS app](https://blog.codinghorror.com/app-pocalypse-now/)
 * Pedagogical approach: it must be easy to use and understand, but it must tell the user what's going on. Using the right musical terminology. Promote the use of the official songbook.
 * You received free, give free (Mt 10:8): the app will always be free to use and open source.
 * Simplicity in everything.
