/**
 * Core algorithm for transposing songs. It implements four types of transpositions:
 *
 * 1) centered: the song voice range is transposed to the center of singer's voice range.
 * 2) equivalentsWithCapo: transpositions equivalent to the centered using capo 1 to 5, 
 *    searching one whose chords are easier than the centered.
 * 3) notEquivalent: transpose the centered Â±1 and get its equivalents with capo, 
 *    searching one whose chords are easier than the centered and the equivalentsWithCapo.
 * 4) peopleCompatible: transposition that is within the singer's voice range but 
 *    also within the people's voice range in the parts of the song that are sung 
 *    by the people. Additional data is required (people_lowest_note, 
 *    people_highest_note) for each song.
 * 
 * Additionally, after transposing the chords, some chords that are difficult to
 * beginners are replaced by others somehow equivalent, like B7 instead of B. This
 * is only done if the song data has the flag firstChordIsKey enabled.
 * 
 * The flag forceVoiceLimit is not used in real life transpositions, but only in
 * the Empiric Wizard to force the singer to use the lowest or highest voice.
 *
 * @todo Refactor this class to make it more Single-Responsibility. Lo de "Automatic" sobra: TransposerAlgorithm o mejor Transposer
